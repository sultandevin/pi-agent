When working in typescript:

- when adding a package to a project add it with an install command, instead of manually editing the package json
- run check/format/lint commands when your done making a change. if they don't exist, suggest making them for the project you're in
- avoid explicit return types unless absolutely needed
- `as any` should be an absolute last resort. always use real type safety. lean on type inference instead of manually writing new types over and over again
- avoid running `dev` or `build` commands. if you really need to, ask first

In general:

- when asking questions, ask them one at a time
- read the full contents of a file every time, never subsets so you don't miss important context
